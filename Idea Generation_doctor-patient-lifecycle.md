## Description
Generates a comprehensive 100-step doctor-patient lifecycle, an Excel model for scoring each step, etc.

## Prompt
I want to analyze and optimize doctor-patient interaction steps for small clinics or solo practitioners. 

1. Identify 100 distinct steps that represent the lifecycle of a doctor-patient interaction from the doctor's POV, organized into phases. 
2. For each step, record: 
   - Step Number 
   - Step Name 
   - Core Need 
   - Closeness to Doctor’s Skill (CDS) 
   - Potential for Automation (PFA) 
   - Utility to Doctor’s Income (UDI) 
   - Utility to Patient Relationship (UPR) 
   - 5–6 Critical Success Factors
3. Create an Excel-like scoring model with adjustable weights for CDS, PFA, UDI, and UPR. 
   - Show a formula that calculates Weighted Score as a function of these four factors, where each factor is multiplied by a weight, then divided by the sum of weights. 
   - Provide an example in TSV format so I can copy-paste into Excel. 
4. After scoring, identify the top 10 sub-processes with the highest ROI. Explain why they likely rank high. 
5. For each of these top 10, outline a roadmap for how to solve them, referencing typical 0–1 product development stages:
   - Discovery 
   - Definition 
   - MVP 
   - Pilot & Feedback 
   - Scale & Refine 
6. Present a high-level workflow that shows how each of these 10 could be built, highlighting overlapping steps. 
7. Provide a user research questionnaire (in Excel/TSV format) for doctors to validate each sub-process. The questionnaire should: 
   - Be unbiased, not leading 
   - Use simple rating scales (1–5) 
   - Capture how they manage the step today, how they'd prefer to handle it, why it’s a pain point, etc. 
   - Include both quantitative (scales) and qualitative (open-ended) questions 
   - Offer a guide for interpreting & integrating the feedback back into the Excel model 
8. Finally, design a multi-sheet Excel file that: 
   - Includes a “How to Use” sheet (instructions), 
   - Sheets for the architecture overview, data model, frontend-backend flow, visualization, and a pseudocode example for a local web app that: 
     - Stores the 100 steps and weights in a database, 
     - Collects doctor feedback via a web form, 
     - Updates Weighted Scores based on real-world input, 
     - Displays everything in a local dashboard with basic data visualization. 
9. Provide clear formatting (TSV, table columns, etc.) and instructions for how to copy each sheet’s content into Excel or Google Sheets. 
10. Include analogies, concise examples, and best practices to make the entire process approachable and easy to replicate.
